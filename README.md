# Forecast Housing Prices
Compare the performance of different SARIMA models on non-stationary housing data. We will first show how to perform exploratory data anlaysis and perform the required data manipulations on your data. The creation and use of a the Augmented Dickey Fuller test for Stationary data will be applied to help us determine the appropriate type of model we should be using. In addition to the ADF test we will also perform Seasonal Decomposition to help use visualize the trend, seasonal, and residual components of our data. 

We will then show how to use Auto ARIMA to identify the appropriate parameters for our Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average  model with, and without exogenous regressors. Finally, we will evaluate model performance when compared with our test set.
